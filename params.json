Tools can be used to draw weather maps, sort clouds etc.\r\n\r\nEach simulation or tool is written in HTML5/CSS/JS and runs in both browsers and mobile.\r\n\r\n### MtnSim\r\nAdjust the initial temperature and vapor pressure of a parcel, \r\ndenoted by a leaf, to observe how saturation occurs as the parcel travels over the mountain. \r\nThe challenge is observe and hypothesize how these parameters affect when and where saturation occurs to identify the \r\nvariety of paths to saturation. \r\n\r\n![Mountain Simulation](https://github.com/pboysen/wxsims/demo/assets/mtnsim.png)\r\n\r\n[Try it!](https://github.com/pboysen/wxsims/demo/sims/mtnsim/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDr. Douglas Yarger (doug.yarger@gmail.com) and Dr. Pete Boysen (pete.boysen@gmail.com)\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
