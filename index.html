		<div class="title">Overview</div>
		<p>Engage your students in active learning about meteorology by using one or more of the WXAPPS listed below.
		Each app is either a simulation or tool designed to let students explore conditions relating to such challenging concepts as solar and terrestrial radiation, 
		humidity variables, temperature lags and adiabatic processes. Tools are also provided to sort clouds and draw weather maps.</p>
		<div class="title">Usage</div>
		<p>
		Use the embed code listed for each app to place in your webpage.  The apps are designed to run in both desktop browsers or on mobile. 
		The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/pboysen/wxapps">GitHub</a> if you want to make enhancements.  
		The apps are freely available and released under the MIT License.</p>

		<img src="docs/img/mtnsim.png" alt="Image of Mountain Simulation"/>
		<p>This app lets the student adjust the initial temperature and vapor pressure of a parcel, 
denoted by a leaf, to observe how saturation occurs as the parcel travels over the mountain. 
The challenge for the student is hypothesize how these parameters affect when (where) saturation occurs to identify the 
variety of paths to saturation.

		<div class="title">Budgetsim</div>
		<img src="docs/img/budgetsim.png" alt="Image of Budget Simulation"/>
		<p>This app challenges the student to hypothesize how input and output flows 
affect the water level in the tank over time. The input flow can be changed during predetermined time periods. 
The output flow is constant during the entire activity. 
The goal is for the student to construct rules that govern tank water level and are generally applicable to parameters 
other than water.

		<div class="title">Radiation Simulation</div>
		<img src="docs/img/radsim.png" alt="Image of Radiation Simulation"/>
		<p>The student collect temperature profile data for day and night in an environment 
that differs only by surface conditions. This activity is intended to be a puzzle since students are not 
expected to have yet been exposed to course materials that explain the profile differences. 
The challenge for the student is to list both what makes sense and what doesn't.</p>

		<p>This app lets the student modify the wind speed, direction, duration, isotherm spacing to observe the 
		impact of these variables on advection and the temperature gradient moves.</p>

		<p>This app introduces the student to the process of condensation and evaporation in a beaker.  
A student can apply heat for a few seconds and watch the system reach equilibrium.</p></p>

		<p>DrawSim lets students draw a variety of symbols on weather maps.  It is divided into three basic tools to let the student:
<ul>
<li>Pressure: wind vectors and pressure regions</li>
<li>Air Mass: place one of eight air mass symbols</li>
<li>IsoPath: draw lines connecting equal values</li>
</ul>
