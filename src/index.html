<h2>Meteorology Simulations</h2>
<p>You can use the following simulations to demostrate the concepts of energy budgets, albedo and adiabatic processes.  
The simulations are freely available.  Each simulation is written in HTML5 and Javascript and will in most modern browsers.</p>
<h3>Mountain Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Adiabatic processes. A leaf symbolizes a parcel of air rising over a mountain.
Graphs display the information as the leaf rises and falls. Users vary the beginning temperature and vapor-pressure of the leaf.</p>

<h3>Radiation Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Differences of thermal exchange among four types of ground surfaces.
Users chose a land type and compare the results side-by-side in a graph.</p>

<h3>Budget Simulation</h3>
<p><strong>Concept:</strong> Energy intake of our atmosphere during the day and the loss of energy at night. 
Users vary the intensity of the sun during the day. 
A tub of water fills up symbolically showing the energy intake of our atmosphere.</p>
